# Implementing-governance-within-Azure-using-Azure-Policies

# End Goal: Enforce secure by default architecture within an Azure environment
- Benefits of using Azure Policy
- 1. Enforce governance of Azure resources (what types of resources are allowed/not allowed to be created in an Azure subscription)
  2. Controls costs (prevent high incurring costs) 
  3. Prevent resource sprawl (prevent stale resources or unauthorized resources from being created)
  4. Enforce compliant resoruces to be created from the very beginning (deny public facing resources from being created)


# Allowed Resources
- [Azure Policy - Allowed Resources](https://github.com/earkevin11/Azure-Policy-Allowed-Resources)



# Not allowed resource types




# Deny creation of Azure resources that allow public access from all networks (key vaults and storage accounts)
- [Azure Policy - Deny creation of resources if public access from all networks is enabled](https://github.com/earkevin11/Azure-Policy---Deny-creation-of-Azure-resources-from-allowing-public-access-from-all-networks)




# Configure logging (diagnostic settings) for Azure resources to ensure monitoring/audit
